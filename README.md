# Asian-butterfly-spread.-Moment-Matching-Monte-Carlo-Heston-Model

In this repo, I present option pricing of Asian butterfly spread using three different approaches. 
First of all, I will use the moment matching method which produces good results but is not very accurate.
Secondly will be basic Monte Carlo simulations. Also, I will analyze the impact of the number of simulations and different parameters on the price of the Asian option.
Thirdly, I will use the Heston model to price the financial product. As the basic assumption of constant volatility contradicts real market behavior. Also, I analyze the impact of different parameters on the option price. Particularly, the impact of the correlation between volatility and asset simulation processes.
