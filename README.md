# Asian-butterfly-spread.-Moment-Matching-Monte-Carlo-Heston-Model

In this repo, I present option pricing of Asian butterfly spread using three different approaches. 
First of all, I use the moment matching method which produces good results but is not very accurate.
Secondly, I use basic Monte Carlo simulations. Also, I will analyze the impact of the number of simulations and different parameters on the price of an Asian option.
Thirdly, I use the Heston model to price the financial product. One of the basic assumptions is constant volatility which contradicts real market behavior. Additionally, I analyze the impact of different parameters on the option price, namely, the impact of the correlation between volatility and asset simulation processes.
